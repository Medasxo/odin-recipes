    <p><em>Nachos in the air fryer are an awesome, quick, and easy snack, that's totally customizable. </em></p>
    <p>  
    The sky's the limit on your ingredient choices, so feel free to make substitutions to suit your tastes. 
    And they can be turned into a main course by adding some protein like shrimp or chicken for a complete meal.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>2,5 ounces thin corn tortilla chips</li>
        <li>0,5 teaspoon taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1,25 cups shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sliced black olives</li>
        <li>6 grape tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C) for about 3 minutes. 
            Line air fryer basket with foil or a parchment liner, and spray with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>Spread out chips in the fryer basket in a single layer, slightly overlapping chips, so the cheese doesn't melt through.
            Lightly dust chips with taco seasoning to get a pop of taco flavor, and sprinkle with shredded cheese. 
            Don't overcrowd the basket.
        </li>    
        <li>
            Top cheese with olives and tomatoes and place basket in the air fryer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Air-fry until cheese is melted and chips are starting to slightly brown on the edges, 5 to 6 minutes. 
            Watch closely to be sure the cheese doesn't burn. If necessary, add additional time until you reach your preferred crispness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Move nachos to a plate, garnish with chopped cilantro, and serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
